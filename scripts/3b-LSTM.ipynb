    "## Deep Learning Sentiment Classifier: Bidirectional LSTM with Word2Vec Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a **deep learning model** for tweet sentiment classification using **Bidirectional LSTM** networks combined with **Word2Vec word embeddings**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Bidirectional LSTM?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sequential Understanding**: Unlike the TF-IDF baseline, LSTMs can capture the **sequential nature** of language, understanding how words relate to each other in context.\n",
    "- **Bidirectional Processing**: By processing text both forward and backward, the model gains a more complete understanding of context around each word.\n",
    "- **Long-term Dependencies**: LSTMs excel at capturing relationships between words that are far apart in a sentence, crucial for understanding sentiment in complex tweets.\n",
    "- **Contextual Awareness**: Can handle negation, sarcasm, and other linguistic nuances that bag-of-words models miss.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Word2Vec Embeddings?\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of sparse TF-IDF vectors, we use **dense Word2Vec embeddings** that capture semantic relationships between words. Words with similar meanings are positioned close to each other in the embedding space, allowing the model to generalize better to unseen vocabulary and understand semantic similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What This Notebook Covers\n",
    "\n",
    "- Loads and preprocesses the training and validation datasets\n",
    "- Trains a custom Word2Vec model on the tweet corpus\n",
    "- Builds bidirectional LSTM architecture with embedding layers\n",
    "- Implements proper text tokenization and sequence padding\n",
    "- Trains the model with early stopping and performance monitoring\n",
    "- Evaluates performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix\n",
    "- Provides analysis of model strengths and limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "This LSTM model represents a significant step up in complexity from our logistic regression baseline, designed to capture the nuanced, context-dependent nature of sentiment in social media text.\n"

    "### Error Analysis: Key Insights and LSTM-Specific Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "The error analysis reveals several important insights into how the Bidirectional LSTM model processes sentiment. By examining the most confidently misclassified tweets from our model output, we can pinpoint specific strengths and weaknesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Over-reliance on Strong Sentiment Keywords\n",
    "\n",
    "While the LSTM considers sequence, it can still be misled by the overwhelming presence of strong sentiment words, especially when context is ambiguous. This is evident in the top false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Example (False Positive):** A tweet like `'usermention cut thank thank thank thank thank thank thank thank thank thank thank'` was incorrectly classified as **Positive** with 0.998 confidence.\n",
    "* **Insight:** The repeated use of \"thank\" created a strong positive signal that the model over-weighted, missing any potentially neutral or negative context from the word \"cut\" or the overall repetitive structure, which can sometimes indicate spam or sarcasm.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Overwhelming Positive Signal Masking Context\n",
    "\n",
    "The model can be misled when tweets contain multiple strong positive sentiment words, even when the overall context suggests the sentiment should be negative. This is particularly evident in formal or achievement-related language that might be used sarcastically:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Examples (False Positives):**\n",
    "    * `'usermention congratulation best song breakthrough performance female'` (Confidence: 0.997)\n",
    "    * `'usermention good news btw great weekend'` (Confidence: 0.996)\n",
    "* **Insight:** The model correctly identified multiple positive words like \"congratulation,\" \"best,\" \"good news,\" and \"great weekend.\" However, these examples strongly suggest potential **data labeling issues** rather than model failures. It's difficult to imagine why tweets containing phrases like \"good news\" and \"great weekend\" would be labeled as negative, unless there's missing context or systematic labeling errors in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Potential Data Labeling Issues vs. Nuanced Context\n",
    "\n",
    "The most confident false negatives (predicted Negative, but actually Positive) are particularly revealing. They contain powerful negative keywords, suggesting the model is making a logical prediction based on the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Examples (False Negatives):**\n",
    "    * `'major headache right'` (Confidence: 0.995)\n",
    "    * `'feel like depress im kind depress'` (Confidence: 0.996)\n",
    "    * `'feeling hurt dred'` (Confidence: 0.995)\n",
    "* **Insight:** These errors strongly suggest one of two things:\n",
    "    1.  **Labeling Errors:** The ground truth labels for these tweets may be incorrect. It's counter-intuitive for a tweet containing \"headache,\" \"depress,\" or \"hurt\" to be labeled as positive.\n",
    "    2.  **Extreme Sarcasm/Context:** If the labels are correct, these tweets represent a level of sarcasm or implicit context (e.g., expressing relief about seeing a doctor for a headache) that is too complex for the current architecture to understand. The model is behaving as expected, but the data's complexity exceeds its capability.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Minor Sensitivity to Tweet Length\n",
    "\n",
    "Our output shows a slight tendency for misclassified tweets to be longer than correctly classified ones, which supports the hypothesis that sequence length affects performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Point:** The average length of misclassified tweets was **48.7 characters**, while correctly classified tweets averaged **45.9 characters**.\n",
    "* **Insight:** Though the difference is minor, it aligns with the idea that longer sequences can sometimes dilute the sentiment signal, making it harder for the LSTM to maintain focus on the most critical parts of the tweet.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Word Embedding Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Errors often involve words that may be poorly represented in the Word2Vec embeddings, particularly domain-specific social media language.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Observation:** Despite 100% embedding coverage in our model, some words may have learned poor representations due to limited context in the training corpus.\n",
    "* **Impact:** The model's performance is inherently tied to the quality of domain-specific embeddings, suggesting that better Twitter-specific embeddings could reduce certain error types.\n",

    "#### Comparison with Baseline Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Improvements over TF-IDF:**\n",
    "- Better handling of word order and basic negation patterns\n",
    "- Reduced sensitivity to individual high-frequency negative words  \n",
    "- More nuanced understanding of context in longer tweets\n",
    "- Bidirectional processing provides fuller context around each word\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quantitative Improvements:**\n",
    "- **Accuracy**: LSTM (80.14%) vs Baseline (78.16%) - 1.98% improvement\n",
    "- **F1 Score**: LSTM (80.15%) vs Baseline (78.62%) - 1.53% improvement\n",
    "- **Precision**: LSTM (81.51%) vs Baseline (77.00%) - 4.51% improvement\n",
    "- **Recall**: LSTM (88.60%) vs Baseline (80.32%) - 8.28% improvement\n",

    "**Evidence-Based Comparison:**\n",
    "The testing code above (\"Testing LSTM vs Baseline on Specific Examples\") evaluates specific examples where the baseline model failed with high confidence (>99%). While the LSTM also misclassifies these difficult cases, it demonstrates a crucial improvement:\n",

    "**Superior Confidence Calibration:**\n",
    "- **Baseline**: Wrong with >99% confidence (dangerously overconfident)  \n",
    "- **LSTM**: Wrong with 0.009-0.179 confidence (appropriately uncertain)\n",

    "**Analysis:** The LSTM's ability to express **uncertainty** on ambiguous cases is a significant improvement over the baseline's overconfidence. In real-world applications, knowing when a model is uncertain is as valuable as getting predictions right. The LSTM recognizes these as difficult edge cases rather than making confident incorrect predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical Implications:**\n",
    "- **Baseline approach**: Would make confident decisions on these ambiguous tweets, potentially causing serious errors\n",
    "- **LSTM approach**: Flags these as uncertain cases for human review or additional analysis  \n",
    "- **Risk management**: Lower confidence scores allow for better decision thresholds and uncertainty quantification\n",

    "#### Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these specific findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Attention Mechanisms**: The patterns suggest that attention-based models (like BERT) might better handle the context-dependent errors we observe, particularly for mixed sentiment and end-of-sequence importance.\n",
    "2. **Domain-Specific Embeddings**: Training Word2Vec on larger Twitter-specific corpora could reduce embedding-related errors.\n",
    "3. **Data Quality Review**: The most confident false negatives warrant investigation of potential labeling errors in the original dataset.\n",
    "4. **Ensemble Approaches**: Combining LSTM with other models might help address its specific blind spots while maintaining its sequential understanding strengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "This evidence-based error analysis demonstrates that while the LSTM model represents a significant improvement over the baseline, the specific examples reveal clear opportunities for enhancement through more sophisticated architectures and training techniques.\n"

    "## Wrap-Up: Strengths and Limitations of Bidirectional LSTM\n",
    "\n",
    "Our LSTM model with Word2Vec embeddings represents a significant advancement over the TF-IDF baseline, demonstrating the power of sequence modeling and semantic embeddings for sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strengths\n",
    "- **Context Awareness**: Captures sequential relationships and word order, essential for understanding negation and complex sentiment expressions.\n",
    "- **Semantic Understanding**: Word2Vec embeddings enable the model to understand semantic relationships between words, improving generalization.\n",
    "- **Bidirectional Processing**: Processes text in both directions, providing fuller context around each word for better sentiment interpretation.\n",
    "- **Improved Performance**: Achieves higher accuracy and F1-score compared to the logistic regression baseline.\n",
    "- **Robustness**: Less susceptible to individual keyword bias, as it considers entire sequence context.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations\n",
    "- **Computational Complexity**: Requires significantly more computational resources and training time compared to linear models.\n",
    "- **Embedding Dependence**: Performance heavily relies on the quality of Word2Vec embeddings trained on the specific domain.\n",
    "- **Memory Requirements**: Bidirectional LSTM layers and sequence processing require substantial memory, especially for long sequences.\n",
    "- **Limited Long-Range Dependencies**: While better than baseline, LSTMs can still struggle with very long-range dependencies in complex tweets.\n",
    "- **Interpretability**: More difficult to interpret than linear models - cannot easily identify which words drive specific predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Comparison with Baseline\n",
    "The LSTM model's ability to understand context and sequence makes it particularly effective for:\n",
    "- Handling negation patterns (\"not bad\" vs \"bad\")\n",
    "- Understanding sentiment modifiers (\"very good\" vs \"good\")  \n",
    "- Processing informal language with non-standard word order\n",
    "- Capturing sentiment in longer, more complex tweets\n",
    "\n",
    "This establishes LSTM as a strong intermediate model between simple baselines and state-of-the-art transformer architectures like BERT.\n"
