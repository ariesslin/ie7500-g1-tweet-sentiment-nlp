        "## Deep Learning Sentiment Classifier: Bidirectional LSTM with Word2Vec Embeddings\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook implements a **deep learning model** for tweet sentiment classification using **Bidirectional LSTM** networks combined with **Word2Vec word embeddings**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why Bidirectional LSTM?\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Sequential Understanding**: Unlike the TF-IDF baseline, LSTMs can capture the **sequential nature** of language, understanding how words relate to each other in context.\n",
        "- **Bidirectional Processing**: By processing text both forward and backward, the model gains a more complete understanding of context around each word.\n",
        "- **Long-term Dependencies**: LSTMs excel at capturing relationships between words that are far apart in a sentence, crucial for understanding sentiment in complex tweets.\n",
        "- **Contextual Awareness**: Can handle negation, sarcasm, and other linguistic nuances that bag-of-words models miss.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why Word2Vec Embeddings?\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead of sparse TF-IDF vectors, we use **dense Word2Vec embeddings** that capture semantic relationships between words. Words with similar meanings are positioned close to each other in the embedding space, allowing the model to generalize better to unseen vocabulary and understand semantic similarity.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What This Notebook Covers\n",
        "\n",
        "- Loads and preprocesses the training and validation datasets\n",
        "- Trains a custom Word2Vec model on the tweet corpus\n",
        "- Builds bidirectional LSTM architecture with embedding layers\n",
        "- Implements proper text tokenization and sequence padding\n",
        "- Trains the model with early stopping and performance monitoring\n",
        "- Evaluates performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix\n",
        "- Provides analysis of model strengths and limitations\n",
        "\n",
        "This LSTM model represents a significant step up in complexity from our logistic regression baseline, designed to capture the nuanced, context-dependent nature of sentiment in social media text.\n"

        "\n",
        "The error analysis reveals several important insights into how the Bidirectional LSTM model processes sentiment. By examining the most confidently misclassified tweets from our model output, we can pinpoint specific strengths and weaknesses.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. Over-reliance on Strong Sentiment Keywords\n",
        "\n",
        "While the LSTM considers sequence, it can still be misled by the overwhelming presence of strong sentiment words, especially when context is ambiguous. This is evident in the top false positives.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Example (False Positive):** A tweet like `'usermention cut thank thank thank thank thank thank thank thank thank thank thank'` was incorrectly classified as **Positive** with 0.999 confidence.\n",
        "* **Insight:** The repeated use of \"thank\" created a strong positive signal that the model over-weighted, missing any potentially neutral or negative context from the word \"cut\" or the overall repetitive structure, which can sometimes indicate spam or sarcasm.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. Struggles with Mixed or Contradictory Sentiment\n",
        "\n",
        "The model finds it challenging to determine the overall sentiment when a tweet contains both positive and negative keywords. The bidirectional context helps, but the model can still get confused, as seen in this false positive:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Example (False Positive):** The tweet `'usermention really amazing go retweet digg nice distressful'` was predicted as **Positive** with 0.997 confidence, but was actually **Negative**.\n",
        "* **Insight:** The model correctly identified strong positive words like \"amazing\" and \"nice.\" However, it failed to give enough weight to the concluding negative word, \"distressful,\" which ultimately defined the tweet's true sentiment. This highlights a limitation in handling sequences where the sentiment shifts at the very end.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. Potential Data Labeling Issues vs. Nuanced Context\n",
        "\n",
        "The most confident false negatives (predicted Negative, but actually Positive) are particularly revealing. They contain powerful negative keywords, suggesting the model is making a logical prediction based on the text.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Examples (False Negatives):**\n",
        "    * `'go doctor headache'` (Confidence: 0.995)\n",

        "    * `'feeling hurt dred'` (Confidence: 0.994)\n",
        "* **Insight:** These errors strongly suggest one of two things:\n",
        "    1.  **Labeling Errors:** The ground truth labels for these tweets may be incorrect. It's counter-intuitive for a tweet containing \"headache,\" \"depress,\" or \"hurt\" to be labeled as positive.\n",
        "    2.  **Extreme Sarcasm/Context:** If the labels are correct, these tweets represent a level of sarcasm or implicit context (e.g., expressing relief about seeing a doctor for a headache) that is too complex for the current architecture to understand. The model is behaving as expected, but the data's complexity exceeds its capability.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 4. Minor Sensitivity to Tweet Length\n",
        "\n",
        "Our output shows a slight tendency for misclassified tweets to be longer than correctly classified ones, which supports the hypothesis that sequence length affects performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Data Point:** The average length of misclassified tweets was **48.7 characters**, while correctly classified tweets averaged **45.9 characters**.\n",

        "1. **Attention Mechanisms**: The patterns suggest that attention-based models (like BERT) might better handle the context-dependent errors we observe, particularly for mixed sentiment and end-of-sequence importance.\n",

        "3. **Data Quality Review**: The most confident false negatives warrant investigation of potential labeling errors in the original dataset.\n",

        "- **Context Awareness**: Captures sequential relationships and word order, essential for understanding negation and complex sentiment expressions.\n",
        "- **Semantic Understanding**: Word2Vec embeddings enable the model to understand semantic relationships between words, improving generalization.\n",
        "- **Bidirectional Processing**: Processes text in both directions, providing fuller context around each word for better sentiment interpretation.\n",
        "- **Improved Performance**: Achieves higher accuracy and F1-score compared to the logistic regression baseline.\n",

        "#### Limitations\n",
        "- **Computational Complexity**: Requires significantly more computational resources and training time compared to linear models.\n",
        "- **Embedding Dependence**: Performance heavily relies on the quality of Word2Vec embeddings trained on the specific domain.\n",
        "- **Memory Requirements**: Bidirectional LSTM layers and sequence processing require substantial memory, especially for long sequences.\n",
        "- **Limited Long-Range Dependencies**: While better than baseline, LSTMs can still struggle with very long-range dependencies in complex tweets.\n",
